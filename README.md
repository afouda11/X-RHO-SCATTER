# X-RHO-SCATTER

Calculates coherent elastic x-ray scattering from either Hartree-Fock or DFT.\ 
The code is still in developemnt and currently serves the single purpose of producing coherent scattering\ 
for 1-3-cyclohexadiene, the results of which will be in our Farady Discussion paper\cite{}\

Further developments and instructions for installation/use coming soon...\

This code uses psi4numpy, orbkit and curbature.\
