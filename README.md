----- X-RHO-SCATTER -----

Calculates coherent elastic x-ray scattering on non-aufbau configurations from either Hartree-Fock or DFT. \

The code is still in developemnt and was developed for 1-3-cyclohexadiene core-hole cation states, \
the results of which can be found in the Farady Discussion paper https://doi.org/10.1039/D0FD00106F \
I am gradually turning this into something more general and efficient over time \ 
pleaee get in touch if you are interested in using it or have any questions!\ 

This code uses psi4numpy, orbkit and curbature. \
