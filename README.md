----- X-RHO-SCATTER -----

Calculates coherent elastic x-ray scattering on non-aufbau configurations from either Hartree-Fock or DFT.

Still under developemnt and developed for coherent x-ray scattering on 1-3-cyclohexadiene core-hole cation states,
the results of which can be found in the Farady Discussion paper https://doi.org/10.1039/D0FD00106F
